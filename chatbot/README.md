## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=300
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# Database Configuration

DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=dream_wear

# Server Configuration
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVER_PORT=5000
DEBUG_MODE=True
```

### **Advanced Configuration**
Edit `config.py` to customize:
- OpenAI model parameters
- Database connection settings
- Server configuration
- Chat history limits

## üåê Web Integration

The chat widget in your website (`includes/chat-widget.php`) is configured to:

1. **Connect to the Flask chatbot API**
2. **Store chat sessions** in localStorage
3. **Load chat history** when reopening the chat
4. **Send user ID** if the user is logged in
5. **Handle intelligent responses** from OpenAI
6. **Maintain conversation context** across sessions

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **OpenAI API Issues**
1. **Check API Key**: Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
2. **Check Credits**: Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits
3. **Check Rate Limits**: Monitor API usage and rate limits
4. **Fallback System**: The chatbot will use fallback responses if OpenAI fails

### **Database Connection Issues**
1. Ensure MySQL server is running
2. Verify database credentials in `config.py`
3. Check if the `dream_wear` database exists
4. Ensure the `chat_logs` table is created

### **Chat Widget Not Working**
1. Make sure the Flask server is running on port 5000
2. Check browser console for CORS errors
3. Verify the API endpoint is accessible: `http://localhost:5000/health`
4. Test with the provided test scripts

### **Performance Issues**
1. **Monitor API Usage**: Check OpenAI API usage and costs
2. **Optimize Responses**: Adjust `max_tokens` and `temperature` in config
3. **Database Optimization**: Add indexes to frequently queried columns
4. **Caching**: Consider implementing response caching for common queries

## üöÄ Deployment

### **Production Considerations**
1. **Environment Variables**: Use proper environment variable management
2. **API Key Security**: Never commit API keys to version control
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for the chatbot service
5. **SSL/TLS**: Use HTTPS in production
6. **Load Balancing**: Consider load balancing for high traffic

### **Docker Deployment**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
